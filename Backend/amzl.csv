Mayte Espinoza,5.0 ,JBL Quantum 100 - Wired Over-Ear Gaming Headphones,"
Some things I really love about this headsetSound Quality - I can truly say that the sound quality of this this headset is crystal-clear. The detachable BOOM microphone uses advanced audio technology and thus does its jobIf you get to isolate the noise, the recording quality is remarkableThe braided 1/8” TRRS cable which assures its durability and are highly resistant to breakage or damageSome things I dont really like (not totally negative)The controls on this JBL are limited to a few basic functions, with the only onboard controls being a volume scroll wheel and a mic mute button. There is No Call button and No play/pause Music Control buttonAnother thing is the headphone isn’t really very portable. The ear cups fold flat and sideways, looking out. It doesn’t fold inwards. Neither does it come with any sort of protective carrying case, so you risk having them snag on something if you just toss them into your bag.The build quality is sort of disappointing, plastic, but for what I need it for, acceptable however, the adjustable headband looks weak at a connection, almost like if you exert simple pressure, it will easily snapNoise Isolation is there but it’s not the best, you hear quite a bit of rumble in the background if you’re listening in a crowded environment, so it’s safer you don’t count on it.In short, If you’re on the hunt for a budget gaming headset you don’t have to think too hard, the JBL Quantum 100P is definitely worth considering. It’s lightweight, easy to use. The mic is okay, the design is comfortable, and it works everywhere. It’s not a spectacular piece of hardware but it is not costly

Ben,5.0 ,"Simple, affordable headset without any annoying extras. (Realtek users, see last paragraph)","
I'm not a fan of gaming headsets that come with their own software, have annoying bright lights, 70 mile long cables that get tangled up, and especially those little midway connectors that can control volume and come unplugged if you tug on the cable by accident. I'm happy to say this is a minimalist gaming headset that fits exactly what my needs are.The headset is comfortable (it is slightly tight like the other reviews said, but I personally prefer that type of fit), the microphone sounds surprisingly good and clear for the price (I have a deeper voice and people noted how much deeper my voice sounded compared to my old headset) and can bend and stay in place where you need it. You just need to buy a $6 TRRS to dual TRS headphone/mic splitter if your computer has separate headphone/mic ports. (I just bought the one that was listed as frequently bought together and it worked fine.)I can see what people are saying about the plastic build quality being susceptible to cracking, as I've done this by accident with an old headset, but if you don't rip your headphones off your head with one hand like an animal you shouldn't have a problem.The audio quality of the headphones is totally acceptable for the price range. Yes it is a little boomy in the low mids, but if you just EQ your audio output that can be reduced and molded to your preference anyway, and the result is a very nice and punchy bass sound. I see reviews that say the sound is better on xyz headphones, but those other brands being compared to are in the $100 range at least. Either way, if you have the expectation of audiophile-tier sound quality, then why would you get a gaming headset? The only reason to get a gaming headset is to avoid the hassle/cost of setting up a separate mic and headphones so it can be all in one, knowing that you are sacrificing audio quality for the convenience. A mic small enough to attach to a headset will never come close to a LDC mic.For my money, a lower tier headset is totally fine for everyday gaming and casual music listening. For $30, I don't really know what more I could want from this product, other than maybe it coming with the TRRS to dual TRS headphone/mic splitter for my laptop's inputs. I might even buy an extra pair in case these ever go out of stock because most headsets are migrating towards bulkier and RGB laden designs I don't enjoy, and it's getting harder to find headsets that are lightweight and minimalist in their design like these are.Initially I had troubles getting Discord to recognize the mic until I realized my Realtek Audio Manager needed to manually set this as a default mic (Go to Microphone -> Set Default Device in Realtek), and I had to uncheck the awful noise suppression setting (Not the Discord one, the Realtek one) to get the full mic quality. This is also specific issues to my computer's software though and in no way reflects the product's quality, I just figured anyone else with this same problem might want the info.

Addison,4.0 ,"For 30 bucks, Hands down the best headset you're going to find","
I bought this headset for my girlfriend a little over a year ago and she has loved it the whole time. We just upgraded to a wireless headset but for the time she had it I was very impressed. First off, for 30 bucks youre not going to find much better. Build quality is all rigid plastic and it's a bit creaky but all headphones in this price range are going to be like that. The sound quality and the mic are amazing and beat some 70-100 dollar headsets I have used. JBL is known for their sound and these are no exception. All frequency ranges come in clear so whether your gaming or listening to music this headset sounds awesome. The best and worst part of the headset is the mic. The mic (when it worked) was the best sounding mic I have heard on a gaming headset. My girlfriend sounded like she was talking through a physical desktop microphone. The fact that it is removable too really was convenient for when she wasn't in calls or using coms in game. The reason I say it is also the worst part of the headset is that the mic stopped working after about a year after she got it. She is not rough with any of her tech and the headset was used normally. The mic stopped working and we could not figure why. So we upgraded her to the Barracuda X which is 3 times the price and the mic doesn't compare in sound quality at all. The last thing I will say is that the headphones look great and you will need to purchase a splitter to use it on a PC but it does work out of the box on some laptops. For the price you can't go wrong with this headset. If I am ever in the need of a budget headset I will definitely recommend and purchase this again.

Zoe Minden,5.0 ,1-Year Mark,"
I have now had my headphones (White) for a full year and a half - I bought them in April 2021, and they still work great. I have a smaller head, and the lowest size setting actually fits, so I suppose that means they run a little bit small but that's exactly what I need. As no  other headphones fit me on their smallest setting, I have been extremely impressed of the quality of my (on-sale) $30 mic'd headphones.- Sound quality is superior for the price, very balanced and of good quality. I have been impressed, and after a year nothing has deteriorated in sound quality. I don't know the right word, but I'm able to get the surround-sound that is needed for first-person shooter games. I know where my enemies are coming from! It's not something I expected from this headset, but I was very pleasantly surprised!- The one minus here is that the mike is a little bit on the quiet side, and I have to manually turn myself up in Discord/Zoom/Steam. But after that, it's a very clear sound without muffling and usually only picks up my voice. It is a detachable mike, but I've detached and reattached it several times, bent and unbent the mike angle, and it still seems durable with zero break-down. I keep it unattached for the most part and have yet to lose it.- The headset itself is very, very comfortable. I can wear it for hours on end without issues or headaches. It is made of a cheaper light-weight plastic, but it's also durable enough to have lasted well over a year - and going! The swivel of the ears also helps with comfort and for ""sealing"" in the sound. So unless the *look* of quality is what you're going for, the light-weight plastic is actually a plus for comfort at a $30 price tag.- The cord is shorter, but if your PC is next to your desk, it won't be an issue.For a fitting pair of headphones with gaming-level quality, accurate sound positioning for games like Halo and Apex (among others), quality sound and comfort, detachable microphone, and a $30 price tag, these are far superior to anything I have ever gotten in the past. If a quieter mike and short cord aren't issues for you, and you're a gamer/student like me looking for quality on a really small budget, these may be the best headphones out there.

BloodSpite,5.0 ,Excellent for price,"
My only complaint about these is I cant keep them on my head. Thats it. Thats the complaint.Ive tried a half dozen different game headsets to spend time with my kids and they all fall apart, sound like garbage, stop working or I feel like Im wearing my safety ear muffs and they quit in under 90 days.These are awesome. Great sound, nice cord flexibility, comfortable and work with pretty much everything from my phone to our game systems.Worth it

Jodie hammond,3.0 ,Fine. Partially works still.,"
The headset itself is fine, but the mic has stopped working properly after 8 months of use. It sounds like a terrible static noise. The audio in the headphones sounds fine still, just the mic has stopped.

Riley,5.0 ,Amazing for the price,"
For $40, these headphones exceeded my expectations. I was looking for an in-between pair to replace my old Razer headphones that were falling apart, and stumbled across these. It's hard to find a budget and semi-high quality pair of white headphones, but here they are!These are not show-stopping in any capacity. They are a relatively cheap build with plastic, and feel somewhat cheap (although, it's not horrible quality). The audio quality is actually really nice and I have no complaints with it. These are as good as most headphones near the $100-120 range, so I would just go with these ones until you save up to invest in a super nice pair.

Nilufar A,5.0 ,"Lasts a long time, even with poor care.","
I have used these headphones for over 3 years and It still works perfectly fine, I treated it with poor care constantly throwing it and It still works good. The Microphone is really good although picks up background noise and the sound quality is even better than a pair of $150 headphones. Although there were some wear and tear for the ear cushioning and a piece of the plastic broke off as well

BRC,4.0 ,"Good sound and easy to use, just wish there was less noise from cord","
Pretty good headphones, over ear is comfy. The flexible mic boom might become a point of breakage, as I move it a lot (don't like it in my eye-line when not in use, already have glasses there!). Sound is good, as far as I can tell. I just work, listen to streaming music and movies, and play quiet games; I'm no connoisseur.My only complaint is the sturdy cord rubs on me and transmits that sound through the plastic. I have to pin it somewhere to get it to really stop. I don't want to use wireless, so it would be great if they found a solution to that.

Justin,4.0 ,"Quite comfortable, ok sound quality","
These headphones are very comfortable for long gaming sessions. That said...the sound quality is very in line with the price point. Be prepared to have to mess with controls to find proper volume and such without an echo. Overall I'm very satisfied with these headphones for the price, even with their imperfections.Hope this review helps.
